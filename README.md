# VectorformToDo
Programming Test

For this test I used Angular and Bootstrap for the front end, which hooks into my MVC and Web Api controllers who talk to a SQL database through Entity Framework.

I also tried unit testing with Moq for the first time, which was interesting and I want to learn more.

A script is included to generate the SQL database.
